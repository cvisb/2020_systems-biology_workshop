## Workshop Resources
### Session 1: Systems Serology/Machine Learning Tutorial
#### Goal:
We will introduce a general machine learning workflow to deal with system serology datasets.
#### Before workshop, please review the items below:
1. Readme file: including Platform installation (R, Rstudio, packages (see Git-hub))
2. Dataset: data to demonstrate the workflow will be taken from Lu et al., Nature Medicine (2019) (Resistor vs LTB in tuberculosis).
3. Notebook Part 1: Dataset exploring, pre-processing
