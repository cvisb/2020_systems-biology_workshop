## Workshop Resources
### Session 1: Systems Serology/Machine Learning Tutorial
#### Goal:
We will introduce a general machine learning workflow to deal with system serology datasets.
#### Before workshop, please review the items below:
1. Readme file: including Platform installation (R, Rstudio, packages)
2. Dataset: data to demonstrate the workflow will be taken from [ Lu et al., Nature Medicine, 2019.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0441-3)
3. Notebook Part 1: Dataset exploring, pre-processing

### Session 2: B Cell Repertoire Sequencing or Identifying T Cell Clusters/Subsets

#### Session 2a: B Cell Repetoire Sequencing

#### Session 2b: Identifying T Cell Clusters/Subsets
