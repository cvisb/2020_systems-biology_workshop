## Workshop Resources
### Session 1: Systems Serology/Machine Learning Tutorial
#### Goal:
We will introduce a general machine learning workflow to deal with system serology datasets.
#### Before workshop, please review the items below:
1. Readme file: including Platform installation (R, Rstudio, packages)
2. Dataset: data to demonstrate the workflow will be taken from [ Lu et al., Nature Medicine, 2019.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0441-3)
3. Notebook Part 1: Dataset exploring, pre-processing

### Session 2a: B Cell Repertoire Sequencing

### Session 2b: Identification and Charaterization T cell Subsets from Single Cell Data
#### Goal:
We will introduce a general workflow to deal with single cell RNA-seq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a goal on identifying and characterizing T cell clusters.
#### Before workshop, please review the items below:
1. Read [readme.md] (https://github.com/watronfire/CViSB_Workshop_TCells/blob/3a961cc3de6daaff4bded8b9130236da99bdcc17/README.md): Instructions for installation of required Python and R packages.
2. Download Dataset: Anndata h5ad file, Zanini et al. PNAS 2018 (Dengue infection vs. Healthy)
3. Load notebook: Binder link coming soon!
